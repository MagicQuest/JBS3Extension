# JBS3Extension
 (my first) VSCode extension for JBS3
 it was lowkey kinda annoying but i figured it out ðŸ˜ˆ
 
 i gotta look up how to upload this one to the market

 oh yeah if you are building this one yourself you need to run `npm install` to generate the node_modules folder because it was too big to include
 to actually run the extension, you have to open this folder in vscode and go to the Run and Debug tab (it should say Run Extension at the top lol)
