# JBS3Extension
 (my first) VSCode extension for JBS3
 it was lowkey kinda annoying but i figured it out ðŸ˜ˆ
 
 i gotta look up how to upload this one to the market

 oh yeah if you are building this one yourself you need to run `npm install` to generate the node_modules folder because it was too big to include
